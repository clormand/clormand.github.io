<p>I consider myself to be more on the side of traditionalism within the realm of Catholicism: I try to avoid the Novus Ordo as much as I can, I have a fondness for scholastic philosophy, I pray my rosary in Latin, I am dissatisfied with how the Church is currently treating modern issues (as well as a dissatisfaction with the current Pontificate ). Yet, after some longer reflection, I am no longer convinced that the traditionalist movement (generally) "has it all". I say this after witnessing certain behaviors from those who identify themselves as traditionalists.

People who come into the traditionalist movement are people who have been fighting an uphill battle before becoming traditionalist. For these people, one of the first relatable or striking things about traditionalism is its unpopularity, or seclusion: many people drive a long way in order to attend a Latin Mass, for instance. Many people (it should be noted that what I am describing is typically a male trait) find this trait relatable, as perhaps many of these people held unpopular views to begin with, found themselves ostracized because of them, and see the elusiveness of traditionalism and find immediate relation. This trait isn't necessarily bad at all, but this is the first movement of how fringe types start to become pervasive within the movement --- through emotion. Contrariwise, a desirable populous for the movement should be those who have entered through careful consideration, research, and prayer (although this is certainly a more masculine requirement).

Though, for those of us within the movement, when totally analyzed, it does seem a bit fringe. To begin with, the Church requires us to hold opinions that feel a bit fringe when compared to modernity.Then, when you admit your preference for the Latin Mass, you are met with confusion from your local priest (or parents, ordinary Catholic friends, etc). And it is doubtless that conflict is tiring on the soul. This taxation on the soul can produce many different effects in a person, but perhaps the most dangerous effect is how it can harden one's heart: to shut a person out from anyone outside the movement and, through their frustrations, stop considering the mental or intellectual statuses of those who are outside the movement. Thorough debate or discussion becomes futile, just tell them to pray their 15 decades every day and visit a special website and call it a day.

It used to be mind-blowing to me that people mistook SSPX supporters for sedevacantists, as it was merely an error stemming from a lack of surface-level inquiry. Yet, as time went on, and through my association with, and observation of a group of SSPX supporters, I began to understand why this error kept being made. The SSPX has a peculiar position: they fully recognize and claim they submit to Pope Francis and the Vatican, but essentially operate as if they were autocephalous. They have their own bishops, who were consecrated by their own permission, who were selected on their own permission, who go around and say Mass on their own permission -- what they do, when they do and where they do it is ultimately up to themselves and not ultimately up to Pope Francis. Where else is this same behavior seen? In Catholicism, at least, this would be the sedevacantist sects. So, perhaps many of these people can't be blamed too much, as the ecclesiastical behavior between the two is hard to distinguish.

And to continue the theme of behavior, the behavior of many SSPX supporters (and worseso sedevacantists) is imprudent to say the least. As many of these people have had their heart hardened through their long swims upstream, to ask them to meet some people where they are at, instead of blasting them with the conclusions of concepts that would otherwise take them much time to come to terms with, might be a tall order. Traditionalists have commonly had a stigma of being cold, or uninviting, and while I have not seen this behavior in the real world, it is certainly prevalent online. People outside of the movement who will publicly say erroneous things that will often conflict with the traditionalist movement will not be met with a gentle invatation to reconsider, but instead will have stones immediately thrown at them. Yes, it is quite clear that not everybody will be saved, as the Fathers make great note of. Yet, as weak as our intellects are, how do we know that such a person is incapable of understanding traditionalist motivations?
