<p>I tell you what. After hanging around SSPX supporters for a while, even at one point finding myself to be partial to their position, in the past week or so I have been reconsidering.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What does it mean to “submit to Rome” when the organization essentially functions as if it were autocephalous?</p></li>
<li><p>“Marcel Lefebvre was a saint” — why are laypeople performing canonizations?</p></li>
<li><p>How many people who go down this route are even familiar with a basic tenant of the ordinary magisterium — that the faithful are required to religiously submit their mind, intellect and will to a teaching, and there are no exceptions for the laity?</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Those are all really good questions and pretty much sums up what led me to abandoning sympathy/support for the SSPX on a ecclesial level (the counter-revolutionary work they do must be recognized and supported).</p>
<p>In ways similar to historically schismatic groups, the SSPX has not only attempted to separate themselves from the jurisdiction of the Church hierarchy but to separate themselves from the Catholics that attend the Novus Ordo Mass. Ecclesiologists have emphasized that schism is invoked in the latter as well as in the former.</p>
<p>Lefebvre’s sainthood is another dubious claim. It’s perfectly find to privately venerate him (likewise with others we may consider holy persons that have not passed away) but it’s never okay to publicly claim that he is in heaven (by prefacing his name with the title ‘St.’).</p>
<p>I find the last objection from the SSPX to be a cop-out. Even Lefebvre accepted - right up until a month before the Econe Consecrations - that magisterial parts of Vatican II and other controversial teachings from the post-V2 Magisterium can be interpreted in light of tradition. Some parts of the council, of course, are not subject to an assent of faith; but the ones that aren’t still must be respected and possibly “countered” charitably and within the jurisdiction of the Church.</p>

<p>Something that has resonated with me for the past couple of months, ever since I read it, is something Erick Ybarra wrote in 2018:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The men of the Vatican are not dunces. They are far more clever than any of the Thomistic manualists who continue to cite Fr. Lagrange or Scheeben or Denzinger. They know exactly what to do, and how to do it, and how to say it, and how to frame it, and how to pass through the technical cones of orthodox dogmatic theology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which, somewhat makes you take a step back: it seems quite unlikely that a small, fringe group such as the Dimond Brothers, or Fr. Anthony Cekada, or the CMRI, has essentially “outsmarted” the Vatican; the theologians working for the Holy See that have spent their entire lives dedicated to learning and applying theology in service of the Church, have seemed to simply forget about an infallible declaration such as Cum Ex Apostolatus, or have become merely unaware of the opinions of St. Robert Bellarmine. If such information was available in the low-key traditional seminaries in the United States, it is most certainly of the working knowledge of the theologians working in the Holy See.</p>
<p>And, this quote has made me come around and start to attempt to pay serious attention to the “modernist” popes of the recent past, such as John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Not that I have learned anything yet, but I have started with the thought of: “If Wojtyla was overseen by Garrigou-Lagrange, and Ratzinger was the head of the CDF until his pontificate, perhaps maybe a lot of these traditionalists might be either underestimating, or misunderstanding the theological/philosophical principles of these men.” It seems like, perhaps for a lot of these traditionalists, there has been an interesting occurence: Many of these people are used to accepting what society would otherwise label as “inconvenient truths”, such as being against homosexuality, fornication, pornography, etc: in this consistent ability to understand these truths which society rejects, they have overestimated themselves to be accurate assesers of truth, and when the men of the Vatican are not breaking through the walls with “absolutely based takes”, their first instinct is to try to move forward from what is perceived as an inaccuracy, leading to schism, recognize-and-resist, etc. Perhaps, in an ironic fashion and from their heightened sense of self, they have failed to recognize the inconvenient truth of clinging to the Holy See.</p>

<p>That’s a strong point regarding the new popes. Looking back on the arguments presented by the Dimond brothers and other anti-conciliar trads, I see that the quotations and teachings they are criticizing seem to be (a) taken wildly out of context or (b) not matched-up with their counter-argument. They have to take extreme measures to try and paint them as heretical, blasphemous, etc.</p>
<p>The only people that are ‘convinced’ by such arguments are those that already have an invested interest in maintaining a position of a vacant see. (I put “convinced” in quotes because, properly speaking, they aren’t being convinced of anything nearly as much as they are reaffirmed through fallacy and philosophical malpractice.)</p>

<p>Just last night I decided to actually investigate a little bit on the reports about Pope Francis insisting Moroccan Catholics to “not seek to proselytize others”: one has to think – why would the Holy Father be telling others not to seek to convert others? Doesn’t this go directly against the Apostles? Of course, Novus Ordo Watch and similar media outlets had a field day with this message. But, of course what these outlets will not report on is <strong>actual</strong> point Pope Francis was trying to make, namely that there is a difference between proselytization (which he is against), and evangelization (which he is for). Pope Francis equates proselytization with argumentative persuasion, through reason and arguments, when he instead advocates evangelization/witness to the faith, such as befriending a non-believer and slowly introduce them to the Catholic life: the qualia expressed through witnessing a Mass or witnessing a group of Catholics standing in solidarity, praying the rosary together, is something which could likely not be expressed through a semiotic mode of reason, such as argumentation.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the philosophy employed by Pope Francis is air-tight (he seems to be a rhetorically-challenged Pope, after all), but the underlying idea of his statement is something much more sensible than what Church Militant Media (and by extension, every media outlet more fringe than them) would have you believe. All in all, I’m not sure who is most at fault for this particular issue: the media for their sensationalist reporting, the traditionalists for failing to look deeper, or the Vatican for not going forward and making the underlying message much more clear? (Perhaps it’s ultimately the media.)</p>
